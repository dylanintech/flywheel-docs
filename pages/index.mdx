# Introduction
 
Welcome to flywheel. Glad you landed here lol. flywheel is a react component library for adding pretty, dynamic leaderboards to your app. Perfect for anyone building a gamified product.

Go on to the next section if you wanna start adding leaderboards in your frontend.
Wanna play with the components before using them in your app? Read on.

## The Playground.

The playground is a risk free place to create leaderboards and share them with your friends/team/users. The leaderboards you create there are their own links and look a little like this:

Start creating in the playground [here](https://playground.myflywheel.app/leaderboards/all). I wrote a small [article](https://flywheelleaderboardsgocrazy.substack.com/p/yooo-u-can-now-create-ur-own-awesome) to help you create one in less than 5 minutes. If you use the article make sure to start from **step 2**. This article is a little outdated - I wrote it when the playground was the entire product.
