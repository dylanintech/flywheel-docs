# Installation
*Note: flywheel is in beta right now. There are edge cases that the library hasn't acocunted for yet.*

 ## Installing flywheel via npm
 flywheel is an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flywheel-leaderboard) and can be installed by running the following in your terminal:
    ``` bash {3} copy
    npm i flywheel-leaderboard
    ```
    
 **Make sure to download the npm package and not the github package. The github package requires a personal access token.**
   
 ## Installing tailwindcss
flywheel uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, so you'll need to install that as well if you're not already using it in your app. Installing tailwind will look a little different depending on your framework.

*Even if you're already using tailwind in your project you still need to add a line in the `content[]` key of your `tailwind.config.cjs` for the proper styling to render.*

  ### React
   First install tailwind via npm and initialize it
        ```bash {3} copy
        npm install -D tailwindcss
        npx tailwindcss init -p
        ```
        
   A file called `tailwind.config.cjs` will pop up in your file structure. Head over there and change it to look this:
        ```js {3} copy
       /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

       module.exports = {
       content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",

       // Path to the tremor module
       "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
       extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
       }
     ```
   Finally head over to `./src/index.css`, remove everything that was there before, and add this:
   
        ```css {3} copy
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
  ### Next.js
    Install tailwind via npm and initialize it w/ postcss as well
        ```bash {3} copy
        npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer 
        npx tailwindcss init -p
        ```
    A file called `tailwind.config.cjs` will pop up in your file structure. If you're using the `/src` directory you'll wanna update it like so:
        ```js {3} copy
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        module.exports = {
        content: [
        // If using the src directory, add:
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
        "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // tremor module

        ],
        theme: {
        extend: {},
        },
        plugins: [],
        }
        ```
    Using the `/app` directory? Update it to this then:
        ```js {3} copy
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        module.exports = {
        content: [
        './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
        './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
        './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
        "./node_modules/@tremor/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // tremor module

        ],
        theme: {
        extend: {},
        },
        plugins: [],
        }
        ```
    Finally, add the tailwind directives to your `globals.css` file:
        ```css {3} copy
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```
